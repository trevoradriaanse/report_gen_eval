I am working on a paper on the effects of human activities involving fossil fuels on the daily lives of ordinary people.\nI want you to write a paper for me about the impacts of extracting and using fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas) on aspects of day-to-day life.  These impacts might, for example, be felt through the air that they breathe, the weather they experience, the food that they eat, or the prices that they pay for things (and that is not a complete list).  I am interested in both beneficial and harmful impacts. I am also interested in ways in which the harmful effects of fossil fuel extraction and use could be reduced through conservation, although for this report I am not interested in information about how other sources of energy such as renewables or nuclear power could substitute for fossil fuels.", "hash": 1111, "items": [{"query_id": "301", "info": {"importance": "vital", "used": false},
