Avengers: Endgame and Avatar are two of the highest-grossing films in history. Avengers: Endgame surpassed Avatar as the highest-grossing film globally, with a box office revenue of $2.787 billion. [D12] This achievement was officially announced in July 2019. [D13] To bring moviegoers back to the box office and increase the revenue of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios implemented several strategies. One of these strategies was re-releasing the film with additional content. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed plans for a re-release, including previously unseen footage, to generate renewed interest and boost ticket sales. [D101] The new version of the film did not include any re-edited scenes within the main feature but instead featured additional scenes after the end credits, including a tribute. [D14] This approach aimed to entice both existing and new audiences to revisit the theaters and contribute to the film's box office success. Similarly, Avatar also made a comeback to reclaim its position as the highest-grossing film. The film was re-released in China, where it achieved a single-day box office revenue of $8 million. [D2] The re-release in China was particularly successful, as it generated significant revenue and propelled Avatar back to the top of the global box office charts. [D1] The film's re-release in China was attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the delay of many new releases and created an opportunity for Avatar to regain its popularity. [D2] In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame and Avatar both held the title of the highest-grossing film globally at different points in time. Marvel Studios strategically re-released Avengers: Endgame with additional content to attract audiences and boost ticket sales. Avatar capitalized on the re-release trend in China, taking advantage of the pandemic-induced delay of new releases. These manipulations aimed to increase the films' box office revenue and solidify their positions as record-breaking blockbusters.
